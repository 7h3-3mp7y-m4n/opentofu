# Contributing to OpenTF

This repository contains OpenTF core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine

OpenTF is **not** currently accepting code contributions. We are still ironing out the legal details of whether we need to set up a DCO, CLA, or whether we don't need any documents of that kind. We're doing our best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible, as we can't wait for the community to be able to contribute!

However, you can already contribute by [opening an issue](https://github.com/opentffoundation/opentf/issues/new/choose)! Bug reports, broken compatibility reports, feature requests, old issue reposts, and well-prepared RFCs are all very welcome.

All major changes to OpenTF go through the public RFC process, including those proposed by the core team. Thus, if you'd like to propose such a change, please prepare an RFC, ideally accompanied by a working Proof-of-Concept draft Pull Request, so that the community can discuss the change and everybody has a chance to voice their opinion.
