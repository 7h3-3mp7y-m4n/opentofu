# Installing OpenTofu on .deb-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

<Buildkite />

You can install OpenTofu from our Debian repository by following the step-by-step instructions below.

## Installing using the installer

You can use the OpenTofu installer script to run the installation.

<CodeBlock language="bash">{DebConvenienceScript}</CodeBlock>

## Step-by-step instructions

The following steps explain how to set up the OpenTofu Debian repositories. These instructions should work on most Debian-based Linux systems.

### Installing tooling

In order to add the repositories, you will need to install some tooling. On most Debian-based operating systems, these tools will already be installed.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep1Script}</CodeBlock>

### Set up the OpenTofu repository

First, you need to make sure you have a copy of the OpenTofu GPG key. This verifies that your packages have indeed been created using the official pipeline and have not been tampered with.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep2Script}</CodeBlock>

Now you have to create the OpenTofu source list.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep3Script}</CodeBlock>

### Installing OpenTofu

Finally, you can install OpenTofu:

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep4Script}</CodeBlock>

### Installation Instructions for Hardened Environments

These installation instructions are designed to support environments with hardened security settings, particularly when dealing with a hardened umask.

The steps provided are tailored for Debian family operating systems.

#### Step 1: Temporary Umask Adjustment

<CodeBlock language="bash">{debmask1}</CodeBlock>

Before initiating the installation, temporarily adjust the umask to accommodate the hardened environment. The script sets a `0027` umask to provide restrictive permissions during the installation process.

#### Step 2: Revert Umask After GPG Key Installation

After the installation, revert the umask to its default value to maintain a secure environment.

<CodeBlock language="bash">{debmask2}</CodeBlock>
