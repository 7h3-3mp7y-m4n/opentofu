# Command: push

!> **Important:** The `opentf push` command is no longer functional. We recommend the [Terraform Cloud CLI integration](/opentf/cli/cloud) instead, which allows you to run remote operations in Terraform Cloud directly from the command line.

The `opentf push` command was an early implementation of remote OpenTF runs. It allowed teams to push a configuration to a remote run environment in a discontinued version of Terraform Enterprise.

The legacy Terraform Enterprise version that supported `opentf push` is no longer available, and there are no remaining instances of that version in operation. Without a service to push to, the command is now completely non-functional.
